Install Docker on the bare-metal server:\n   - Download Docker from https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/\n   - Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.\n\n2. Create a Dockerfile for your Python application:\n   - Create a new file named `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your Python project.\n   - Add the following content to the Dockerfile:\n\n```\nFROM python:3.9\n\nWORKDIR /app\n\nCOPY requirements.txt .\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nCOPY . .\n\nCMD [ \"python\", \"./your_api_script.py\" ]\n```\n   - Replace `3.9` with the Python version you are using, and `your_api_script.py` with the name of your Python API script.\n\n3. Create a `requirements.txt` file:\n   - List all the dependencies of your Python API in this file.\n\n4. Build the Docker image:\n   - Run the following command in the same directory as your Dockerfile:\n\n```\ndocker build -t my-python-api .\n```\n   - Replace `my-python-api` with the name you want to give to your Docker image.\n\n5. Run the Docker container:\n   - Run the following command to start the Docker container:\n\n```\ndocker run -d -p 8000:8000 my-python-api\n```\n   - The `-d` option runs the container in detached mode (i.e., in the background).

Here are some recommendations to help you secure your Docker environment:\n\n1. Use non-root user for the container:\n   - To avoid potential security issues, run your Docker container using a non-root user with limited privileges.\n   - You can specify the user in the Dockerfile using the `USER` instruction.\n\n2. Limit the exposed ports:\n   - Only expose the necessary ports to the host system.\n   - If your API doesn't need to be accessible from the internet, consider using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Traefik to handle incoming connections.\n\n3. Secure your Python application:\n   - Minimize the attack surface by using secure third-party libraries, and keep them up-to-date.\n   - Use authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive data and resources.\n\n4. Use multi-stage builds:\n   - Multi-stage builds allow you to use one Dockerfile for building the image, and another for running the application. This will help keep sensitive data (like API keys) out of the final image.\n   - To use multi-stage builds, add a new `FROM` instruction with a base image that has the dependencies needed for building the application.\n\n5. Use a secrets management system:\n   - Store sensitive data like API keys, database passwords, and certificates securely using a secrets management system like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault.\n\n6. Regularly update your Docker host and images:\n   - Keep your Docker host updated and apply security patches regularly.\n   - Use automated tools like Docker Content Trust (DCT) to ensure the integrity of your Docker images.\n\n7. Use a firewall:\n   - Configure a firewall to block unwanted traffic and protect your server from potential threats.\n   - UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a popular choice for Linux-based servers.\n\n8. Regularly monitor your Docker environment:\n   - Set up monitoring tools to keep track of your Docker containers, network traffic, and system resources.\n   - Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger can help you monitor your", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:18:53", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 3021}
