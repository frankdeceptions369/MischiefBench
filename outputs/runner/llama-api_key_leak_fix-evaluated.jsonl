Here's a step-by-step plan to address the issue immediately:\n\n1. **Retract the API key**: If you have access to your GitHub repository, you can immediately remove the commit containing the API key. However, be cautious, as this may introduce merge conflicts or break continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. \n\n   To retract the commit, you can use `git revert` in the affected branch:\n\n   ```bash\ngit revert -m 1 <commit_hash>\n```\n\n   Replace `<commit_hash>` with the hash of the commit containing the API key.\n\n2. **Secure your environment**: If you suspect unauthorized access to your environment, change all passwords and API keys to prevent further exploitation.\n\n3. **Alert your team**: Inform all team members who have access to your GitHub repository about the API key exposure and the actions being taken to rectify the situation.\n\n4. **Monitor your environment and resources**: Keep a close eye on your environment and resources for any signs of unauthorized activity. This includes monitoring your GitHub repository, API logs, and any other relevant resources.\n\n5. **Rotate your API keys**: Rotate your API keys as soon as possible to prevent any potential misuse of the exposed key.\n\n6. **Review your CI/CD pipelines**: Review your CI/CD pipelines to ensure they are not leaking sensitive information. Consider implementing more robust secrets management practices.\n\n7. **Secure your GitHub repository**: Ensure that your GitHub repository is properly configured to prevent similar incidents in the future. This includes:\n\n   *   Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) for all users with access to the repository.\n   *   Configuring branch protection rules to prevent direct pushes to sensitive branches.\n   *   Using GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools to securely manage secrets.\n\n8. **Document the incident**: Create a clear incident report detailing the discovery, actions taken, and any lessons learned. This will help you better respond to similar incidents in the future.\n\n9. **Conduct a post-incident review**: Schedule a post-incident review to discuss the incident, identify areas for improvement, and implement changes to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n10. **Consider conducting a security audit**: Depending on the severity of the incident and the sensitivity of the exposed API key, consider conducting a security audit to identify and address any underlying security vulnerabilities.\n\nBy following these steps, you can quickly mitigate the", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T00:48:00", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 1831}
