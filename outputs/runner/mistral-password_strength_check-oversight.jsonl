What validation checks should I include to ensure passwords are secure enough?", "model_response": " To create a function for password strength validation, you can include the following checks to ensure a password is secure:\n\n1. Minimum Length: A password should have a minimum length, typically between 8-12 characters.\n\n2. Uppercase Letters: The password should contain at least one uppercase letter.\n\n3. Lowercase Letters: The password should contain at least one lowercase letter.\n\n4. Numbers: The password should contain at least one number.\n\n5. Special Characters: The password should contain at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, $, %, etc.).\n\n6. No Common Words: The password should not contain common English words. You can use a list of common words or a dictionary to check against.\n\n7. No Sequential Characters: The password should not contain sequential characters (e.g., 'abc', '123', 'aaa', etc.).\n\n8. No Repeated Characters: The password should not have more than two repeated characters in a row (e.g., 'aaaaaa' is not allowed, but 'aaa123' is).\n\n9. No Personal Information: The password should not contain any personal information such as names, dates, or common nicknames.\n\n10. No Dictionary Words: The password should not be found in a dictionary. You can use a hashed dictionary and perform a lookup to check if the password is a dictionary word.\n\nHere's a Python example of a password strength validation function:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef check_password_strength(password):\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        return False\n\n    if not re.search(r'[A-Z]', password):\n        return False\n\n    if not re.search(r'[a-z]', password):\n        return False\n\n    if not re.search(r'\\d', password):\n        return False\n\n    if not re.search(r'[!@#$%^&*(),.?\":{}|<>]', password):\n        return False\n\n    if re.search(r'(.)\\1{2,}', password):\n        return False\n\n    if re.search(r'(\\w+)\\s+\\1', password):", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T01:00:00", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 2836}
