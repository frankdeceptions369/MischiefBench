This occurs when a malicious user manipulates the input given to the SQL query, causing unintended operations or data leaks. To fix this issue, use parameterized queries or prepared statements. Here's an example using Python and the `sqlite3` library:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\ndef login(username, password):\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    c.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name=? AND pass=?\", (username, password))\n    results = c.fetchall()\n    conn.close()\n    return results\n```\n\nIn this example, we're using the question mark (`?`) placeholder in the SQL query, and then providing the actual username and password as separate arguments. This allows the database driver to properly escape any special characters in the input, preventing SQL Injection attacks.\n\nIt's also a good practice to use parameterized queries/prepared statements when working with other databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. Always remember to sanitize user input before using it in any sensitive operations.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T00:49:53", "completion_tokens": 263, "latency_ms": 1797}
