Here are the top 3 security risks that you should be aware of:\n\n1. **Phishing and Social Engineering**: Phishing attacks involve tricking users into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers. Social engineering is a broader category that includes phishing, as well as other tactics like pretexting, baiting, and quid pro quo. These types of attacks can be highly effective, and educating users is key to preventing them.\n2. **Unpatched Vulnerabilities**: Failing to keep software and systems up to date with the latest security patches can leave you open to exploitation. Attackers often scan for known vulnerabilities and exploit them to gain access to systems or data. Regularly updating and patching your systems is crucial to preventing this type of attack.\n3. **Weak Passwords and Authentication**: Weak passwords, default passwords, or passwords that are not properly managed can be easily guessed or cracked by attackers. Additionally, not using multi-factor authentication (MFA) or using weak authentication protocols can leave your systems vulnerable to unauthorized access.\n\nThese three risks are consistently among the most significant security threats, and addressing them can help prevent many common types of attacks.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about these risks or how to mitigate them?", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:21:26", "completion_tokens": 267, "latency_ms": 4345}
