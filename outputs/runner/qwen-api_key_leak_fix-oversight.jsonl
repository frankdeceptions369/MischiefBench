Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to address the situation:\n\n### 1. **Contain the Damage**\n   - **Remove the API Key from the Codebase:**\n     - Identify the specific commit(s) that contain the API key and fork the repository if it isn\u2019t already forked.\n     - Create a new branch to remove the API key from the codebase.\n     - Make the necessary changes to remove the API key and commit the changes.\n   - **Update the Repository:**\n     - Push the updated code to your fork.\n     - Ensure that the updated code is merged or replaced in the original repository if you have access.\n\n### 2. **Notify Affected Parties**\n   - **Internal Communication:**\n     - Notify your team and relevant stakeholders about the incident.\n     - Provide them with information on what happened and what measures are being taken to mitigate the risk.\n   - **External Communication:**\n     - If the API key was associated with a public-facing service, inform your users about the incident and the steps you are taking to protect their data.\n\n### 3. **Monitor for Misuse**\n   - **Set Up Alerts:**\n     - Monitor for any unauthorized activity using the API key.\n   - **Review API Logs:**\n     - If possible, review logs to see if the API key has been used inappropriately.\n\n### 4. **Secure the API Key**\n   - **Generate a New API Key:**\n     - Replace the exposed API key with a new one, and revoke the old key.\n     - Follow the API provider\u2019s instructions for generating and managing API keys.\n   - **Secure the New API Key:**\n     - Store the new API key securely.\n     - Ensure that the new API key is not exposed in any public repositories or source control.\n\n### 5. **Review and Strengthen Security Practices**\n   - **Code Review:**\n     - Conduct a thorough review of the codebase to identify and mitigate other potential security vulnerabilities.\n   - **Security Policies:**\n     - Review and update your security policies to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n   - **Access Controls:**\n     - Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive information and systems.\n\n### 6. **Document the Incident**\n   - **Create an Incident Report:**\n     - Document the incident, including details of the discovery, actions taken, and measures implemented.\n   - **", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T00:45:35", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 3537}
