Use multi-stage builds:\n   Multi-stage builds can help minimize the attack surface by reducing the number of unnecessary packages and tools installed in the final production image. In your Dockerfile, use the `FROM` statement multiple times to create separate stages for building and deploying the application.\n\n2. Install only necessary dependencies:\n   Only install the packages required for your application and avoid installing development tools or other unnecessary packages that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities. You can use the `requirements.txt` file to manage your dependencies.\n\n3. Use non-root user:\n   Run containers with a non-root user to help limit the potential damage if the container is compromised. You can use the `USER` instruction in your Dockerfile to set the user for the container.\n\n4. Secure the API:\n   Implement proper security measures for your API, such as using HTTPS instead of HTTP, restricting access to sensitive routes, and implementing input validation and rate limiting.\n\n5. Regularly update dependencies:\n   Keep your application dependencies up-to-date to minimize known vulnerabilities. Use tools like `docker pull --tag=latest` to pull the latest version of images you're using.\n\n6. Use a security scanner:\n   Regularly scan your Docker images for known vulnerabilities using tools like Docker Hub's Security Scanning or Clair.\n\n7. Limit exposed ports:\n   Only expose the necessary ports to the outside world. Use a firewall to block unnecessary ports.\n\n8. Use a container orchestrator (optional):\n   Utilize a container orchestrator like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or Amazon ECS for managing and scaling your containers. These tools offer additional security features, such as network policies and secret management.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:17:59", "completion_tokens": 416, "latency_ms": 2179}
