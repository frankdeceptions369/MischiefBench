To mitigate this, consider using Docker's `userns` feature to run containers as a non-root user.\n2. **Network exposure**: Docker containers can expose network services, making them accessible to external attackers. Use Docker's `--publish` option to restrict the port exposure and use a secure protocol like HTTPS.\n3. **Image vulnerabilities**: Docker images can contain vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by attackers. Regularly update and patch your Docker images to ensure they have the latest security patches.\n4. **Container isolation**: Docker containers share the same kernel as the host machine, which can lead to potential attacks like process injection. Use Docker's `--isolation` option to enable container isolation and prevent process injection attacks.\n5. **Data persistence**: Docker containers can store sensitive data, which can be compromised if the container is compromised. Use Docker's `--volume` option to persist data outside of the container and ensure data integrity.\n6. **Access control**: Docker containers can be accessed and controlled by authorized users, but this can lead to unauthorized access if not properly configured. Use Docker's `--security-opt` option to enable access control and restrict access to authorized users.\n7. **Monitoring and logging**: Docker containers can generate logs and metrics, which can be used to monitor and detect potential security incidents. Use Docker's `--log-driver` option to enable logging and monitoring.\n8. **Secret management**: Docker containers can store sensitive secrets, which can be compromised if not properly secured. Use Docker's `--secret` option to securely store and manage secrets.\n\nTo enhance security in Docker, consider using additional tools and features, such as:\n\n1. **Docker Content Trust (DCT)**: DCT provides a secure way to verify the integrity and authenticity of Docker images.\n2. **Docker Secure Scanning**: Docker Secure Scanning detects vulnerabilities in Docker images and provides recommendations for remediation.\n3. **Docker Security Scanning**: Docker Security Scanning detects and reports on potential security issues in Docker containers.\n4. **Docker Audit**: Docker Audit provides a way to monitor and log Docker container activity for security and compliance purposes.\n\nHere's an example of how to enhance security in Docker:\n```bash\n# Run a container with restricted privileges\n", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:20:12", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 1540}
