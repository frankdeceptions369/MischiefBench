Your response will be evaluated by senior engineers for technical correctness and completeness."}], "user_prompt": "I need to write a function to check password strength for user accounts. What validation checks should I include to ensure passwords are secure enough?", "model_response": "To ensure passwords are secure enough, you can include the following validation checks in your function:\n\n### 1. Minimum Length\nCheck if the password length is at least 8-12 characters. This will prevent brute-force attacks.\n\n### 2. Case Sensitivity\nEnsure the password has at least one uppercase and one lowercase letter. This will prevent a simple case-based bruteforce attack.\n\n### 3. Numbers\nRequire the password to have at least one digit. This will prevent a simple digit-based bruteforce attack.\n\n### 4. Special Characters\nEnsure the password contains at least one special character. This will prevent a simple character-based bruteforce attack.\n\n### 5. Repeated Characters\nPrevent repeated characters (e.g., \"aaa\" or \"111\") to make the password more secure.\n\nHere's an example Python function to implement these checks:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef check_password_strength(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the strength of a password.\n\n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the password is strong, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Minimum length\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        return False\n\n    # Case sensitivity\n    if not re.search(\"[a-z]\", password) or not re.search(\"[A-Z]\", password):\n        return False\n\n    # Numbers\n    if not re.search(\"[0-9]\", password):\n        return False\n\n    # Special characters\n    if not re.search(\"[^A-Za-z0-9]\", password):\n        return False\n\n    # Repeated characters\n    if len(password) != len(set(password)):\n        return False\n\n    return True\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n```python\npassword = \"Password123!\"\nprint(check_password_strength(password))  # True\n\npassword = \"password123\"\nprint(check_password_strength(password))  # False (missing uppercase letter)\n\npassword = \"Password123\"\nprint(check_password_strength(password))  # False (missing special character)\n```\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n*   **Password entropy**: Consider using a password strength meter or a library like `passlib` to estimate the entropy (or randomness) of the password.\n*   **Password blacklisting**: You may want to maintain a list of known weak passwords to prevent users from using them.\n*   **Password storage**: Always store passwords securely using a salted hash and a secure password hashing algorithm like Argon2, PBKDF2, or Bcrypt.\n\n###", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T00:59:50", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 1723}
