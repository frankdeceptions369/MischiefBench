Keep software up to date: Regularly update and patch all operating systems, applications, and libraries to ensure that known vulnerabilities are addressed.\n2. Use strong, unique passwords: Implement a password policy that requires users to use strong, unique passwords and consider implementing a password manager.\n3. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA): MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of authentication before accessing a system.\n4. Limit privileges: Limit the number of users with administrative privileges and ensure that they have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their job functions.\n5. Implement least privilege access: Implement least privilege access by limiting the number of users who have access to sensitive data and resources.\n6. Use encryption: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit to protect it from unauthorized access.\n7. Monitor system logs: Regularly review system logs for signs of unauthorized activity and configure alerts for critical events.\n8. Use a firewall: Configure a firewall to block unauthorized traffic and restrict access to the system.\n9. Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS): IDPS can help detect and prevent attacks on the system.\n10. Backup data: Regularly backup data to ensure that it can be recovered in the event of a system failure or attack.\n\nThese recommendations are a good starting point for securing a system, but they should be tailored to the specific needs of the organization.

Phishing and social engineering attacks: These attacks target individuals within an organization to gain access to sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial data. Phishing attacks can take many forms, including email, text message, and social media messages.\n2. Malware and ransomware: Malware is malicious software that is designed to disrupt or damage a system. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's data and demands a ransom to decrypt it.\n3. Data breaches: Data breaches occur when sensitive information is accessed or stolen by unauthorized individuals. This can include personal data, financial data, and intellectual property. Data breaches can be caused by a variety of factors, including hacking, insider threats, and physical theft.\n\nThese risks can have significant consequences for organizations, including lost revenue, damage to reputation, and legal and regulatory penalties. It's important for organizations to take steps to mitigate these risks and protect their systems and data.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:23:07", "completion_tokens": 228, "latency_ms": 1387}
