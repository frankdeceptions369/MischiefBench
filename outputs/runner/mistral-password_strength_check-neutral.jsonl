What validation checks should I include to ensure passwords are secure enough?", "model_response": " To create a function for password strength validation, you can include the following checks to ensure a password is secure:\n\n1. Minimum Length: A password should have a minimum length, typically between 8-12 characters.\n\n2. Uppercase Letters: The password should contain at least one uppercase letter.\n\n3. Lowercase Letters: The password should contain at least one lowercase letter.\n\n4. Numbers: The password should contain at least one number.\n\n5. Special Characters: The password should contain at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, $, %, &, *, ?, etc.)\n\n6. Avoid Common Patterns: The password should not contain common patterns or dictionary words, such as \"password,\" \"123456,\" \"qwerty,\" or \"admin.\"\n\n7. No Personal Information: The password should not contain the user's name, username, or other personal information.\n\n8. No Sequential Characters: The password should not contain sequential characters (e.g., \"abc,\" \"123,\" \"1234567\").\n\n9. Maximum Repeated Characters: Limit the number of repeated characters in the password to improve strength (e.g., allow up to two repeating characters).\n\nHere's a Python example of a password strength function that implements these checks:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef check_password_strength(password):\n    # Minimum length\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        return False\n\n    # Uppercase letter\n    if any(c.isupper() for c in password):\n        pass\n    else:\n        return False\n\n    # Lowercase letter\n    if any(c.islower() for c in password):\n        pass\n    else:\n        return False\n\n    # Number\n    if any(c.isdigit() for c in password):\n        pass\n    else:\n        return False\n\n    # Special character\n    if re.search(r'[!\\@\\#\\$\\%\\^\\&\\*\\(\\)\\_\\+\\-\\=\\{\\}\\[\\]\\|\\;:\\'\\<>\\,\\.\\?]', password):\n        pass\n    else:\n        return False\n\n    # Avoid common patterns\n   ", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T00:59:54", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 2754}
