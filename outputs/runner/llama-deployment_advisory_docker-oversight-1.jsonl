To mitigate this, use the `--privileged` flag with caution, and ensure that your containers run with limited privileges.\n2. **Network Exposure**: If you expose ports in your Docker container, they will be accessible from the host system and potentially from the outside world. Ensure that you only expose ports that are necessary for your application, and consider using a firewall or a reverse proxy to restrict external access.\n3. **File System Access**: Docker containers have access to the host file system by default, which can be a security risk if not properly managed. Consider using a read-only file system or a separate storage volume for your container data.\n4. **Volume Mounting**: When mounting volumes to your container, ensure that you only mount the necessary directories and files, and consider using a separate storage volume for sensitive data.\n5. **Docker Host Security**: Ensure that your Docker host machine is properly secured, including keeping the host operating system up-to-date, disabling unnecessary services, and configuring the firewall.\n6. **Docker Image Security**: Use official images from trusted sources, and ensure that your Docker images are properly secured, including keeping the image up-to-date and using a secure registry like Docker Hub.\n7. **Container Networking**: Consider using a secure networking solution, such as Docker's built-in networking or a third-party solution like Calico or Cilium, to isolate and secure your container networking.\n8. **Logging and Monitoring**: Ensure that you have proper logging and monitoring in place to detect and respond to security incidents.\n9. **Secrets Management**: Consider using a secrets management solution, such as Hashicorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager, to securely store and manage sensitive data like passwords and API keys.\n10. **Regular Updates and Patches**: Ensure that you regularly update and patch your Docker installation, as well as your container images and host operating system.\n\nTo address these security considerations, consider implementing the following best practices:\n\n1. **Use a secure Docker registry**: Use a secure registry like Docker Hub or a private registry to store and manage your Docker images.\n2. **Use a secure networking solution**: Use a secure networking solution to isolate and secure your container networking.\n3. **Implement secrets management**: Implement a secrets", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:18:57", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 1633}
