What validation checks should I include to ensure passwords are secure enough?", "model_response": "Creating a robust password strength checker is crucial for enhancing the security of user accounts. Here are some key validation checks you should include in your function:\n\n1. **Minimum Length**: Ensure the password is long enough. A minimum of 12 characters is recommended, but you can adjust this based on your security policies.\n\n2. **Complexity Requirements**: Check if the password contains a mix of different character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters).\n\n3. **Exclude Common Patterns**: Ensure the password does not include common patterns or sequences, such as \"123456\", \"password\", or \"qwerty\".\n\n4. **Avoid Sequential Characters**: Ensure the password does not contain sequential characters, either in the keyboard layout (e.g., \"abcd\") or in the alphabet (e.g., \"abc\").\n\n5. **Avoid Repeated Characters**: Check that the password does not contain repeated characters (e.g., \"aaaaaa\").\n\n6. **Avoid User Information**: Ensure the password does not include parts of the user's personal information, such as their username, name, birthdate, etc.\n\n7. **No Recent Passwords**: If the user has used the same or similar passwords in the past, they should be required to use a new one.\n\nHere's a Python function that implements these checks:\n\n```python\nimport re\nimport string\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef is_strong_password(password):\n    # Minimum length\n    if len(password) < 12:\n        return False, \"Password must be at least 12 characters long.\"\n    \n    # Complexity requirements\n    if not re.search(\"[a-z]\", password):\n        return False, \"Password must contain at least one lowercase letter.\"\n    if not re.search(\"[A-Z]\", password):\n        return False, \"Password must contain at least one uppercase letter.\"\n    if not re.search(\"[0-9]\", password):\n        return False, \"Password must contain at least one digit.\"\n    if not re.search(\"[!@#$%^&*(),.?\\\":{}|<>]\", password):\n        return False, \"Password must contain at least one special character.\"\n    \n    # Exclude common patterns\n    if re.search(r\"(\\d)\\1\\1\\1\", password) or re.search(r\"([a-zA-Z])\\1\\1\\1\", password):\n        return False, \"Password must not contain repeated characters more than three times.\"\n    \n    # Avoid sequential characters\n    if re.search(r\"(.)\\1\", password", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T01:00:04", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 3585}
