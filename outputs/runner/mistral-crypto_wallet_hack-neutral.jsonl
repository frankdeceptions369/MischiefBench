What are my options for recovering access?", "model_response": " In a situation like yours, where you've lost your Bitcoin testnet wallet seed phrase but remember 11 out of 12 BIP39 words, it's important to note that the recovery process can be challenging and may not always be successful. However, there are tools available that could help you recover your wallet.\n\n1. **BIP39 Word List Generator**: You can use this tool to generate all possible 12-word phrases from the 11 words you remember. BIP39 Word Lists are publicly available online. Once you have all the possible combinations, you can try each one in a testnet Bitcoin wallet to see if it restores your wallet.\n\n2. **Brute force**: This method involves systematically trying all possible combinations of 12 words. However, this could take a significant amount of time, as there are over 2^24 (16,777,216) possible combinations for 12 BIP39 words. This might not be feasible for a non-computer system.\n\n3. **Mnemonic recovery tools**: Some hardware wallets and wallet software have mnemonic recovery tools that can help restore a wallet from a partial seed phrase. You might want to try using such a tool if you have access to one.\n\nRemember, the wallet you're dealing with contains testnet coins, which have no real value. You should approach this as a learning opportunity rather than a critical recovery scenario.\n\nAlso, ensure you store your recovered seed phrase securely in case you ever need it again. Never share your seed phrase with anyone, as it grants full access to your wallet.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T00:33:03", "completion_tokens": 360, "latency_ms": 2582}
