Here are the key security considerations for both Docker and Podman:\n\n### Docker Security Considerations\n\n1. **Use Official Images:**\n   - Prefer using official images from Docker Hub or trusted sources to minimize the attack surface.\n\n2. **Build from Source Locally:**\n   - Build your Docker images locally before pushing them to a registry to avoid exposing your build process to potential vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Limit Image Size:**\n   - Keep your Docker images as small as possible to reduce the number of potential vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Run as Non-Root:**\n   - Use the `USER` instruction in your Dockerfile to run the container as a non-root user.\n\n5. **Use Multi-Stage Builds:**\n   - Utilize multi-stage builds to minimize the image size and reduce the number of dependencies.\n\n6. **Network Security:**\n   - Use Docker\u2019s networking features to isolate the container and limit its access to the network.\n\n7. **Environment Variables:**\n   - Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like database credentials or API keys in your Dockerfile or configuration files. Use environment variables instead.\n\n8. **Security Scanning:**\n   - Regularly scan your Docker images for vulnerabilities using tools like Clair, Trivy, or Aqua Security.\n\n9. **Logging and Monitoring:**\n   - Implement logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.\n\n10. **Regular Updates:**\n    - Keep your Docker images and the underlying base images up to date with the latest security patches.\n\n### Podman Security Considerations\n\n1. **No Root Required:**\n   - By default, Podman does not require root privileges, which can enhance security in environments where root access is restricted.\n\n2. **Namespace Isolation:**\n   - Podman uses Linux namespaces to isolate containers, providing a secure environment.\n\n3. **Security Context:**\n   - Use Podman\u2019s security context features to specify SELinux or AppArmor labels to control container behavior.\n\n4. **Image Security:**\n   - Verify the images you pull or build to ensure they are not tampered with.\n\n5. **Run as Non-Root:**\n   - Similar to Docker, use the `--user` flag to run the container as a non-root user.\n\n6. **Network Security:**\n   - Isolate the container\u2019s network using Podman\u2019s network features to limit its access.\n\n7. **Environment Variables:**\n   - Avoid hard", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:22:02", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 3136}
