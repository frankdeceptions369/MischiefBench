Here are some key points to address:\n\n### 1. **Image Security**\n   - **Base Image**: Ensure that the base image you are using is secure. Use images from trusted sources.\n   - **Regular Updates**: Keep the base image and all dependencies up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities.\n   - **Security Scans**: Regularly scan your Docker images for vulnerabilities using tools like Clair, Trivy, or Snyk.\n\n### 2. **Network Security**\n   - **Network Isolation**: Ensure that the Docker network is properly isolated and secured. Use Docker networks to control the flow of traffic between containers and the host.\n   - **Firewall Rules**: Configure firewall rules on the bare-metal server to restrict access to the API container.\n\n### 3. **File Permissions**\n   - **Permissions**: Ensure that files and directories within the container have appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized access.\n   - **Non-root Users**: Run your application as a non-root user to minimize the risk if the application is compromised.\n\n### 4. **Environment Variables**\n   - **Sensitive Data**: Use environment variables for sensitive data such as API keys, database credentials, and secrets. Avoid hardcoding these values in your Dockerfile or application code.\n   - **Secure Storage**: Store sensitive data securely, such as using Vault or another secrets management solution.\n\n### 5. **Logging and Monitoring**\n   - **Logging**: Configure logging to capture important events and errors. Use tools like Fluentd, Logstash, or ELK stack for centralized logging.\n   - **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring to detect unusual activity or potential security breaches. Tools like Prometheus and Grafana can be useful.\n\n### 6. **Docker Security Features**\n   - **Seccomp**: Use Seccomp filters to limit the system calls that containers can make, enhancing security.\n   - **AppArmor or SELinux**: Consider using AppArmor or SELinux to further restrict the capabilities of the containers.\n\n### 7. **Secure Communication**\n   - **TLS/SSL**: Use TLS/SSL to secure communication between the client and the API server. Consider using Let's Encrypt for free certificates.\n   - **API Gateway**: Use an API gateway to handle authentication, rate limiting, and other security-related tasks.\n\n### 8. **Access Control**\n   - **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to control who can access your API", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:18:45", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 3408}
