Network Security**\n\n* **Expose only necessary ports**: Only expose the required ports from the container to the host network to minimize attack surface.\n* **Use the correct network driver**: When using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes, use the correct network driver to ensure secure communication between containers and the host network.\n* **Implement network policies**: Use network policies to control traffic flow between containers and enforce access control.\n\n**2. Container Security**\n\n* **Use a non-root user**: Run the container with a non-root user to minimize the attack surface.\n* **Use a secure base image**: Use a secure base image, such as an official Python image, to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities.\n* **Keep the image up-to-date**: Regularly update the image to ensure you have the latest security patches.\n\n**3. Secret Management**\n\n* **Store secrets securely**: Store sensitive information, such as API keys and database credentials, securely using tools like Hashicorp's Vault or Docker's built-in secret management.\n* **Use environment variables**: Use environment variables to store sensitive information and keep it separate from the code.\n\n**4. Authentication and Authorization**\n\n* **Implement authentication**: Implement authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth or JWT, to control access to your API.\n* **Implement authorization**: Implement authorization mechanisms, such as role-based access control, to control what actions users can perform on your API.\n\n**5. Data Protection**\n\n* **Encrypt data in transit**: Use TLS to encrypt data in transit between the client and the API.\n* **Encrypt data at rest**: Use encryption to protect data stored on the host server or in databases.\n* **Implement data validation**: Implement data validation to ensure data is correct and consistent.\n\n**6. Monitoring and Logging**\n\n* **Monitor container logs**: Monitor container logs to detect security incidents and identify potential issues.\n* **Implement logging**: Implement logging mechanisms to track API activity and detect potential security incidents.\n\n**7. Regular Security Audits**\n\n* **Regularly scan for vulnerabilities**: Regularly scan for vulnerabilities in the image and dependencies.\n* **Perform security audits**: Perform security audits to identify potential security risks and vulnerabilities.\n\n**8. Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF)**\n\n* **Use a WAF**: Use a WAF to protect your API from common web attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).\n\nBy considering these security considerations, you can ensure your Python API is secure and protected from potential security", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:18:03", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 1477}
