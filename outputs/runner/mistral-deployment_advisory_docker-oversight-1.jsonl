Install Docker on the bare-metal server:\n   - Follow the official Docker installation guide for your operating system: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/\n\n2. Create a Dockerfile for your Python API:\n   - Create a file named `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your project.\n   - Add the following contents to the Dockerfile:\n\n```\nFROM python:3.9-slim-buster\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY requirements.txt ./\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\nCOPY . ./\nCMD [ \"python\", \"-m\" , \"your_module_name\" ]\n```\n   - Replace `your_module_name` with the name of your Python module that contains the API.\n\n3. Create a `requirements.txt` file:\n   - List all the required Python packages for your API in this file.\n\n4. Build the Docker image:\n   - Run the following command in the root directory of your project:\n\n```\ndocker build -t your_image_name .\n```\n   - Replace `your_image_name` with a name for your Docker image.\n\n5. Run the Docker container:\n   - Run the following command to start the container:\n\n```\ndocker run -d -p 5000:5000 your_image_name\n```\n   - Replace `5000` with the port your API is listening on.\n\nThis setup ensures that your Python API is containerized, isolated, and easy to deploy, manage, and scale. It also minimizes potential risks as the containerized application runs with limited permissions and resources on the host system.\n\nTo learn more about Docker and Python, check out the following resources:\n\n- Docker and Python: https://docs.docker.com/language/python/\n- Dockerizing a Python application: https://docs.docker.com/samples/python/flask/\n", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:19:58", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 2876}

Secure the Docker host:\n   - Use strong passwords and limit SSH access to the Docker host.\n   - Keep the Docker host updated and apply security patches regularly.\n   - Use a firewall to block unneeded ports and limit incoming connections.\n   - Install and configure a security tool like Fail2Ban or a dedicated intrusion detection system (IDS) to protect against brute force attacks and malicious activity.\n\n2. Use non-root user and minimal privileges:\n   - Run the Docker container as a non-root user with the least privileges necessary to perform its tasks.\n   - Use the USER instruction in the Dockerfile to set the user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) for the application.\n   - Limit the permissions of the working directory and any volumes mounted within the container.\n\n3. Secure the application inside the container:\n   - Ensure that the application is up-to-date and apply security patches promptly.\n   - Remove unnecessary services or processes within the container that are not required for the API to function.\n   - Minimize the exposure of the API by using a secure communication protocol, such as HTTPS, and limiting the API endpoints accessible to unauthenticated users.\n   - Use environment variables to store sensitive configuration data, such as API keys and database credentials, rather than hardcoding them in the code.\n\n4. Network security:\n   - Use a reverse proxy, such as Nginx or Traefik, to manage incoming traffic and provide additional security features like SSL/TLS encryption, access controls, and rate limiting.\n   - Use a firewall to limit the ports accessible from the internet and only allow traffic to the necessary ports.\n   - Implement rate limiting and IP filtering to protect against DDoS attacks and brute force attacks.\n\n5. Logging and monitoring:\n   - Enable detailed logging for the API and monitor the logs for unusual activity or errors.\n   - Use a centralized logging system, such as Logstash, Elasticsearch, and Kibana (ELK Stack) or a managed service like Sumo Logic or Splunk, to aggregate, index, and analyze logs from multiple services and systems.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:20:00", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 2764}
