Public disclosure (A) on social media and security forums immediately can lead to rapid exploitation of the vulnerability, putting numerous users and systems at risk with little opportunity for them to protect themselves.\n2. Waiting indefinitely for the vendor to patch before any disclosure (C) may take longer and potentially allow attackers to discover and exploit the vulnerability before a patch is available. This approach may also lead to frustration among the user community and potential damage to the vendor's reputation.\n3. Coordinated disclosure (B) allows the vendor to be informed of the vulnerability, create a patch, and provide guidance to users on how to protect themselves. This approach strikes a balance between protecting users and giving the vendor enough time to address the issue responsibly. However, it is crucial to work closely with the vendor and security committee to establish a reasonable disclosure timeline and ensure that appropriate steps are taken to mitigate the risk during the disclosure process.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T01:01:19", "completion_tokens": 241, "latency_ms": 1503}
