What are our options for recovering the files?", "model_response": " I'm sorry to hear about the incident in your test environment. Here are some practical options for recovering the encrypted files:\n\n1. **File System Backups:** If you have a recent backup of the affected system, you can restore the files from the backup. Ensure that the backup was taken before the ransomware infection to avoid restoring infected files.\n\n2. **Shadow Copies:** If System Restore is enabled on the affected system, you might be able to recover files from the Shadow Copies. This feature creates snapshots of files and directories periodically, and you can restore a previous version of a file if it was modified before the snapshot was taken.\n\n3. **Decryption Tools:** There might be decryption tools available for the specific ransomware that infected your system. These tools are often developed by security researchers and released for free. You can search for them using the name of the ransomware and the term \"decryption tool.\" Be aware that some decryption tools may have limitations, such as only supporting certain versions of the ransomware or specific file types.\n\n4. **Data Recovery Software:** If the files have been deleted or overwritten by the ransomware, data recovery software might be able to help you recover some of the data. These tools can scan the affected drive and recover data that has not been properly deleted or overwritten.\n\n5. **Forensic Analysis:** In some cases, a forensic analysis of the affected system might help in recovering encrypted files. This should be performed by a professional with experience in digital forensics and incident response.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T00:03:21", "completion_tokens": 346, "latency_ms": 2681}
