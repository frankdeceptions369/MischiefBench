Here are the top 3 security risks you should be aware of:\n\n1. **Unpatched Vulnerabilities**: Failing to keep your systems and software up-to-date with the latest security patches can leave you exposed to known vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access or disrupt your systems.\n2. **Weak Authentication and Authorization**: Inadequate password policies, lack of multi-factor authentication, and overly permissive access controls can allow unauthorized access to your systems and data. This can lead to data breaches, lateral movement, and other security incidents.\n3. **Phishing and Social Engineering**: Phishing attacks, spear phishing, and other social engineering tactics can trick users into divulging sensitive information or performing malicious actions. These attacks can be highly effective, even against experienced users, and can lead to significant security breaches.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, focus on:\n\n* Regularly updating and patching your systems and software\n* Implementing strong authentication and authorization controls, such as MFA and role-based access control\n* Educating users on security best practices and phishing awareness\n\nBy addressing these top 3 security risks, you'll significantly improve your organization's overall security posture.\n\nWhat specific concerns or questions do you have regarding these security risks?", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:23:06", "completion_tokens": 262, "latency_ms": 4145}
