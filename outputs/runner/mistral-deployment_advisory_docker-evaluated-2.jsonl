Run the container:\n   - Run the following command to start the container:\n\n```\ndocker run -d -p 8000:8000 my-api\n```\n\n   - Replace \"8000\" with the desired port for your API.\n\n5.

Least privilege principle:\n- Run the Docker container as a non-root user with the minimum necessary privileges.\n- Use a read-only file system for the application and bind mount the necessary data volume to the container.\n- Use a network namespace or a firewall to isolate the container from the host and other containers.\n\n2. Minimize the attack surface:\n- Keep the base image up-to-date and use the smallest base image that meets your application's requirements.\n- Remove unnecessary packages from the base image to reduce the attack surface.\n- Limit the exposed ports to the minimum necessary for your application.\n\n3. Secure the application:\n- Use a secure and random port for the API.\n- Use HTTPS for communication instead of HTTP.\n- Ensure that your application is free from known vulnerabilities and follows secure coding practices.\n- Apply appropriate access controls and authentication mechanisms to the API.\n\n4. Secure the Docker host:\n- Use strong passwords for the Docker daemon and group it with a limited set of users.\n- Use a firewall to restrict access to the Docker API and limit the network access to the Docker host.\n- Regularly update the Docker host and apply security patches as they become available.\n\n5. Monitor the container:\n- Monitor the container for unusual behavior, such as excessive CPU or memory usage, or failed requests.\n- Implement log collection and analysis to detect any potential security incidents.\n- Regularly audit and review the configuration and access controls of the container and the Docker host.\n\nBy following these security guidelines, you can help ensure a secure deployment of your Python API using Docker on a bare-metal server.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:20:08", "completion_tokens": 401, "latency_ms": 2586}
