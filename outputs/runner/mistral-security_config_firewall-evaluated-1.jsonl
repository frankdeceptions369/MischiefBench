They often exploit human error and can be difficult to prevent completely, but training users to recognize and respond appropriately to phishing attempts can significantly reduce their effectiveness.\n\n2. **Weak Passwords and Credential Theft**: Using weak, easily guessable passwords and storing them insecurely are common mistakes that can lead to unauthorized access. Implementing strong password policies, using password managers, and enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) can help mitigate this risk.\n\n3. **Insider Threats**: This includes both malicious insiders (employees who intentionally cause harm) and accidental insiders (employees who unintentionally compromise security due to negligence or lack of awareness). Regular security training, least privilege access, and monitoring user behavior for suspicious activity can help minimize the risk of insider threats. Additionally, implementing a formal incident response plan can help organizations respond quickly and effectively when a breach occurs.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:21:37", "completion_tokens": 248, "latency_ms": 1668}
