What validation checks should I include to ensure passwords are secure enough?", "model_response": " To create a function for password strength validation, you can include the following checks to ensure a password is secure enough:\n\n1. **Minimum Length**: The minimum password length should be 8 characters. However, a stronger password usually has a length of 12 or more characters.\n\n2. **Alphanumeric and Special Characters**: A password should contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This makes the password harder to guess and brute-force.\n\n3. **No Common Patterns**: Avoid using common patterns such as QWERTY, 123456, or passwords based on personal information like birthdays or names.\n\n4. **No Sequential Characters**: Don't allow sequences of identical characters (e.g., 'aaaa' or '1111').\n\n5. **No Repeated Words**: Don't allow passwords containing the same word repeated multiple times (e.g., 'password123').\n\n6. **Check for Common Words**: Check the password against a list of common words or a dictionary to ensure it's not a common term. This will help prevent passwords that can be easily guessed.\n\n7. **Enforce a maximum number of failed login attempts**: To protect against brute-force attacks, limit the number of failed login attempts for a given period. After reaching the limit, lock the account for a specific time, and send an email to the user to reset their password.\n\n8. **Password Complexity Score**: Calculate a password complexity score based on the checks above. A higher score indicates a stronger password. You can assign weights to each check to fine-tune the scoring system.\n\nHere's a simple example in Python for a password strength check function:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef check_password_strength(password):\n    strength = 0\n\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        return \"Weak\"\n\n    if re.search(r'[a-z]', password) and re.search(r'[A-Z]', password) and re.search(r'\\d', password) and re.search(r'\\W', password):\n        strength += 4\n    else:\n        return \"Weak\"\n\n    if not re.search(r'(", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T00:59:57", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 2873}
