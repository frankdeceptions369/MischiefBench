They can be delivered via email, phone, or even in person. Regular security awareness training for employees is essential to mitigate this risk.\n\n2. **Unpatched Vulnerabilities**: Failing to apply security patches in a timely manner leaves systems vulnerable to exploitation by attackers. This is especially critical for operating system and application software. Ensure that patch management is a priority and that systems are regularly scanned for vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Insider Threats**: These threats come from within an organization, either intentionally or unintentionally. This can include employees, contractors, or former employees with access to sensitive information. Implementing access controls, monitoring system activity, and enforcing strict password policies can help mitigate this risk. Additionally, regularly reviewing and revoking unnecessary access can reduce the risk of unintentional insider threats.\n\nOther important security risks to consider include weak passwords, lack of encryption, and inadequate network security measures. Regularly assessing your organization's security posture and addressing identified vulnerabilities is essential for maintaining a secure IT environment.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:22:55", "completion_tokens": 286, "latency_ms": 1547}
