Here are three significant security risks to be aware of:\n\n1. **Unpatched Vulnerabilities**: Outdated software and unpatched vulnerabilities can leave your systems open to exploitation. Regularly update and patch your operating systems, applications, and firmware to prevent attackers from using known vulnerabilities.\n2. **Weak Authentication and Authorization**: Inadequate password policies, lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA), and overly permissive access controls can allow unauthorized access to your systems. Implement strong password policies, MFA, and role-based access control to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.\n3. **Phishing and Social Engineering**: Phishing attacks and social engineering tactics can trick users into divulging sensitive information or gaining access to your systems. Educate your users on security best practices, and implement measures like email filtering and monitoring to detect and prevent these types of attacks.\n\nThese are just a few of the many security risks out there, but they're some of the most common and significant ones to be aware of. \n\nWhat specific security concerns are you dealing with in your environment?", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:24:57", "completion_tokens": 226, "latency_ms": 6838}
