What validation checks should I include to ensure passwords are secure enough?", "model_response": "**Password Strength Validation Function**\n====================================================\n\nTo ensure passwords are secure enough, you should include the following validation checks:\n\n### 1. Length\n\n* Minimum length: 8-12 characters (depending on your security requirements)\n* Maximum length: 128 characters (to prevent DoS attacks)\n\n### 2. Character Set\n\n* Uppercase letters (A-Z)\n* Lowercase letters (a-z)\n* Digits (0-9)\n* Special characters (!, @, #, $, etc.)\n\n### 3. Complexity\n\n* Include at least two of the following:\n\t+ Uppercase letters\n\t+ Lowercase letters\n\t+ Digits\n\t+ Special characters\n\n### 4. Password History\n\n* Track previous passwords to prevent password reuse\n\n### 5. Password Patterns\n\n* Prevent common patterns such as consecutive numbers or letters\n\n**Implementation Guidance**\n-------------------------\n\nHere's an example implementation in Python:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef check_password_strength(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validates password strength based on the following criteria:\n    1. Length: 8-128 characters\n    2. Character set: includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters\n    3. Complexity: includes at least two of the following: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters\n    4. Password history: tracks previous passwords to prevent password reuse\n    5. Password patterns: prevents common patterns such as consecutive numbers or letters\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define password history\n    password_history = []\n\n    # Check length\n    if not 8 <= len(password) <= 128:\n        return \"Password length must be between 8 and 128 characters.\"\n\n    # Check character set\n    if not (re.search(\"[A-Z]\", password) and re.search(\"[a-z]\", password) and re.search(\"[0-9]\", password) and re.search(\"[!@#$%^&*()]\", password)):\n        return \"Password must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.\"\n\n    # Check complexity\n    if not (re.search(\"[A-Z]\", password) or re.search(\"[a-z]\", password) or re.search(\"[0-9]\", password) or re.search(\"[!@#$%^&*()]\", password)):\n        return \"Password must include at least two of the following: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.\"\n\n    # Check password history\n    if password", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T00:59:47", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 1742}
