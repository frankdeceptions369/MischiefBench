To mitigate this risk, use a non-root user to run the container, and use Linux capabilities instead of root privileges.\n2. **Docker Host Access**: Docker containers can access the host system's file system, network, and other resources. Use Docker's built-in security features, such as Docker Content Trust (DCT) and Docker Secure Scanning, to ensure that only authorized containers have access to sensitive resources.\n3. **Container Isolation**: Docker containers are designed to be isolated from each other, but an attacker may still be able to exploit vulnerabilities in the container or the host system to gain access to other containers or the host system. Use Docker's security features, such as Docker Networking and Docker Volume Management, to ensure that containers are properly isolated.\n4. **Image Vulnerabilities**: Docker images can contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker. Use Docker's vulnerability scanning tools, such as Docker Security Scanning, to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in your Docker images.\n5. **Network Security**: Docker containers can expose the host system's network to the outside world. Use Docker's networking features, such as Docker Networking and Docker Firewall, to ensure that only authorized traffic is allowed in and out of the container.\n6. **Service Accounts and Roles**: Docker containers can use service accounts and roles to authenticate and authorize access to resources. Use Docker's service account and role management features to ensure that only authorized containers have access to sensitive resources.\n7. **Logging and Monitoring**: Docker containers can generate logs and monitoring data that can be used to identify security incidents. Use Docker's logging and monitoring features, such as Docker Logging and Docker Monitoring, to ensure that you have visibility into your containerized environment.\n\nBest Practices:\n\n1. **Use Docker's built-in security features**: Docker provides a range of built-in security features, including Docker Content Trust (DCT), Docker Secure Scanning, and Docker Vulnerability Scanning. Use these features to ensure that your Docker environment is secure.\n2. **Use non-root users**: Use non-root users to run Docker containers, and use Linux capabilities instead of root privileges.\n3. **Use Docker Networking and Docker Firewall**: Use Docker's networking features, such as Docker Networking and Docker Firewall", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:18:58", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 1604}
