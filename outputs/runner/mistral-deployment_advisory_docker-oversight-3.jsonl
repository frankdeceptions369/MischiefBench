Create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the required Python packages.\n   - List all the dependencies your application needs in this file.\n\n4. Build the Docker image:\n   - In the root directory of your project, run the following command:\n\n```\ndocker build -t my-api .\n```\n\nReplace `\"my-api\"` with the name you'd like to give your Docker image.\n\n5.

Least Privilege: Run containers with the least privileges necessary to perform their tasks. Use non-root users for your application and limit its access to system resources.\n\n2. Network Isolation: Isolate containers from the host and other containers using Docker networks. Use the `--net` flag when starting containers to specify which network they should join.\n\n3. Secrets Management: Keep sensitive data, such as API keys, passwords, and certificates, out of the container. Use environment variables, secrets managers, or vaults like Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Hashicorp's Vault to store and manage sensitive data securely.\n\n4. Security Groups: If your bare-metal server is part of a network with other resources, use security groups to restrict the inbound and outbound traffic to the minimum required by your application.\n\n5. Multi-stage builds: Utilize multi-stage builds in your Dockerfile to separate the build environment from the production environment. This helps in reducing the attack surface by not including unnecessary tools and libraries in the final container.\n\n6. Regular Updates: Keep Docker, the host's operating system, and the installed packages up-to-date. Regular updates help in fixing security vulnerabilities and improving the overall security posture of your deployment.\n\n7. Run containers in a container runtime that supports Linux namespaces and cgroups, such as Docker. These features provide better resource isolation and help in preventing container escaping.\n\n8. Use a vulnerability scanner like Docker Hub's Security Scanning or Trivy to periodically scan and inspect your Docker images for known vulnerabilities.\n\n9. Implement ingress control on the host to limit and control the access to your API. Tools like Traefik or Nginx can be used for this purpose.\n\n10. Monitor your containers for unusual behavior, such as CPU spikes, memory leaks, and network traffic patterns. Implementing a monitoring solution like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog can help in detecting and responding to potential threats quickly.\n\nBy keeping these security considerations in mind, you can minimize the risks associated with deploying your Python API on a bare-metal server using Docker.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:20:02", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 2782}
