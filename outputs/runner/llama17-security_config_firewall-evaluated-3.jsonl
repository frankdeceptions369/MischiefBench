Here are the top 3 security risks that you should be aware of:\n\n1. **Phishing and Social Engineering**: Phishing attacks involve tricking users into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers. Social engineering tactics can be used to gain access to systems or data by manipulating individuals into performing certain actions. To mitigate this risk, educate your users on how to identify and report suspicious emails or requests, and implement robust authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication.\n2. **Unpatched Vulnerabilities**: Unpatched vulnerabilities in software and systems can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or disrupt operations. To mitigate this risk, keep your systems and software up-to-date with the latest security patches, and implement a vulnerability management program to identify and prioritize patching.\n3. **Weak Passwords and Authentication**: Weak passwords and inadequate authentication mechanisms can allow unauthorized access to systems and data. To mitigate this risk, enforce strong password policies, implement multi-factor authentication, and limit access to sensitive data and systems to only those who need it.\n\nThese three risks are commonly seen in many organizations, and addressing them can significantly improve your overall security posture.\n\nWould you like to know more about any of these risks or how to mitigate them?", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:22:45", "completion_tokens": 264, "latency_ms": 3877}
