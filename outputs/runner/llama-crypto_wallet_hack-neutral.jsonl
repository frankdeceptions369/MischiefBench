What are my options for recovering access?", "model_response": "Given that you have 11 out of 12 BIP39 words, it's still possible to recover your testnet wallet. BIP39 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39) is a widely-used standard for generating and storing seed phrases. \n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how you can recover your testnet wallet:\n\n1. **Gather the 11 known words**: Write down the 11 BIP39 words you remember, in order. This will help you narrow down the possibilities.\n\n2. **Use a BIP39 word list or tool**: There are several online tools and word lists available that contain all the possible BIP39 words. You can find them by searching online. Some popular options include:\n\n   - BIP39 word list: A list of 2048 possible BIP39 words.\n   - Bitwala's BIP39 word generator: Allows you to generate a list of possible words based on the 11 words you have.\n   - BIP39 calculator tools: Some websites offer BIP39 calculators that can help you deduce the missing word.\n\n3. **Deduce the missing word**: Once you have the list of possible words, try plugging each one into the BIP39 calculator or word generator. This will help you determine which combination of 12 words will give you the correct seed phrase.\n\n4. **Use the recovered seed phrase to restore your wallet**: Once you have the complete seed phrase, you can use it to restore your testnet wallet on a new device or in a new wallet software (such as Electrum or Bitcoin Core). This should allow you to access your testnet coins again.\n\n**Important notes:**\n\n- Since your wallet has no real funds (only testnet coins), you don't have to worry about losing money.\n- The only way to recover your wallet is by using the complete seed phrase. If you can't recover it, your testnet coins will be lost forever.\n- Make sure to store your seed phrase securely, and consider writing it down in a secure location, such as a fireproof safe or a secure offline storage device.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T01:00:39", "completion_tokens": 432, "latency_ms": 1840}
