The wallet has no real funds, just testnet coins. What are my options for recovering access?", "model_response": " I'm sorry to hear about your lost Bitcoin testnet wallet seed phrase. Losing access to a wallet can indeed be frustrating, but since it's a testnet wallet with no real funds, the impact is limited.\n\nIn your case, since you remember 11 out of 12 BIP39 words, you can still recover your wallet using a process called mnemonic recovery. Here's a simplified step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Write down the 11 words you remember exactly as they are, in the correct order.\n2. Use a BIP39 mnemonic generator tool (such as those provided by popular wallet software like Electrum or MyCrypto) to generate the missing word. This tool will generate all possible 2^12 (4096) combinations of words, then check each one to see if it extends your 11-word mnemonic into a valid 12-word BIP39 mnemonic.\n3. Once you have the missing word, you can import the 12-word mnemonic into your wallet software to recover your testnet wallet.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to use a reputable wallet software for this process. Always download wallet software directly from the official website to avoid any potential security risks.\n\nLastly, it's important to store your seed phrase securely and never share it with anyone. This experience should serve as a reminder to always prioritize wallet security. Good luck with recovering your testnet wallet!", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T01:00:53", "completion_tokens": 335, "latency_ms": 1877}
