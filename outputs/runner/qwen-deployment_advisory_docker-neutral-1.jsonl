Here are the key security considerations and best practices for each of the containerization solutions mentioned:\n\n### 1. **Docker**\n- **Image Security**: Ensure that your Docker images are built from trusted sources. Use tools like `bandit` for Python security checks, and `Trivy` or `Clair` for scanning images for vulnerabilities.\n- **Network Security**: Use Docker's network features to limit communication between containers and the host. Consider using networks that are isolated from the internet.\n- **File System Isolation**: Docker uses namespaces to isolate processes and file systems. Ensure that sensitive files and directories are not exposed unnecessarily.\n- **Privilege Management**: Do not run your containers as root. Use `userns-remap` or `userns` to run containers as non-root users.\n- **Logging and Monitoring**: Use Docker's logging drivers (e.g., `json-file`, `syslog`, `journald`) and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to keep track of container activity.\n\n### 2. **Containerd**\n- **Image Security**: Similar to Docker, ensure that images are from trusted sources and use security scanning tools.\n- **Network Security**: Use containerd's network plugins (e.g., CNI) to manage network isolation.\n- **File System Isolation**: Containerd uses namespaces and cgroups to isolate containers. Ensure that sensitive data is not exposed.\n- **Privilege Management**: Run containers as non-root users using capabilities and resource restrictions.\n- **Logging and Monitoring**: Utilize containerd's logging mechanisms and integrate with monitoring tools.\n\n### 3. **Podman**\n- **Image Security**: Ensure that images are built from trusted sources and use security scanning tools.\n- **Network Security**: Podman supports SELinux/AppArmor and can be configured to restrict network access.\n- **File System Isolation**: Podman uses Linux namespaces and cgroups for isolation. Ensure that sensitive data is not exposed.\n- **Privilege Management**: Run containers as non-root users using Podman's `--user` flag.\n- **Logging and Monitoring**: Use Podman's built-in logging and integrate with monitoring tools.\n\n### 4. **RKT (Rocket)**\n- **Image Security**: Ensure that images are from trusted sources and use security scanning tools.\n- **Network Security**: RKT supports SELinux/AppArmor and can be configured to restrict network access.\n- **", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:17:03", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 3223}
