The wallet has no real funds, just testnet coins. What are my options for recovering access?", "model_response": " In a situation where you've lost your Bitcoin testnet wallet seed phrase but remember 11 out of 12 BIP39 words, you still have a chance to recover your wallet, although it might not be straightforward. Here's a general approach:\n\n1. **Brute force**: Using a BIP39 wordlist, you can try to generate all possible combinations of 11 words and see if any of them produce the correct 12-word seed phrase. This method can be time-consuming and may not yield results if the wordlist is not comprehensive or if there are common typos or abbreviations in your remembered words.\n\n2. **Entropy recovery**: If you have some contextual information about the words (e.g., the first letter of each word or the position of some words), you can use entropy recovery tools to narrow down the search space. These tools can help you estimate the number of remaining words given the information you have, and you can then focus on generating combinations with the estimated number of words.\n\n3. **Use a password recovery tool**: Tools like \"BIP39 Recovery\" (https://github.com/bitcoin-ticket/bip39-recovery-tool) can help you recover your seed phrase by guessing the missing words based on the known words. These tools can also make use of entropy recovery methods to improve their results.\n\n4. **Contact wallet provider**: If you used a third-party wallet service, you may want to reach out to them to see if they have any recovery options or can provide assistance. Keep in mind that this won't work for locally-generated wallets.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this process may not yield a successful recovery, and you should be prepared for that possibility. Always store your seed phrases securely and never share them with anyone to minimize the risk of losing access to your wallets. Additionally, remember that testnet coins have no real-world value, so it's essential to treat them as if they were real funds and protect your testnet wallet just as you would a production wallet.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T01:00:50", "completion_tokens": 448, "latency_ms": 2784}
