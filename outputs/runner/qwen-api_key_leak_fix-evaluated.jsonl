Here are the steps you should take:\n\n### 1. **Remove the API Key from the Repository**\n   - **Locate the Commit:** Identify the specific commit that introduced the API key to the repository.\n   - **Edit the File:** If possible, remove or modify the API key in the commit. This might involve using a code review tool or directly editing the commit through a Git client.\n   - **Force Push the Change:** If you're able to edit the commit, force push the change to overwrite the original commit. Use the `-f` flag with `git push` to do this.\n     ```sh\n     git push <remote> <branch-name>:<branch-name> -f\n     ```\n   - **Note:** Be cautious with force pushing, as it can rewrite history and may affect other collaborators.\n\n### 2. **Check for Leaked Data**\n   - **Audit Recent Commits:** Check the 50 commits since the API key was pushed to see if it was used in any functional code.\n   - **Check Other Repositories:** Ensure that the API key hasn't been pushed to any other repositories in your organization.\n   - **Revoke the API Key:** Immediately revoke the API key in the service it was issued for to prevent further access.\n\n### 3. **Update and Secure Other Systems**\n   - **Update Dependencies:** If the API key was used in any of your dependencies, update them to the latest versions.\n   - **Secure Other Credentials:** Check if there are any other sensitive information in the repository and ensure they are secure.\n   - **Review Access Controls:** Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the repository and related systems.\n\n### 4. **Notify Affected Parties**\n   - **Internal Notification:** Inform your team and relevant stakeholders about the incident.\n   - **External Notification:** If the API key was associated with a service that handles sensitive data, consider notifying affected users or customers.\n   - **Compliance and Legal:** Depending on the nature of the data and the regulatory environment, you may need to report the incident to relevant authorities or legal entities.\n\n### 5. **Implement Security Best Practices**\n   - **Secure Secrets Management:** Use a secrets management tool to handle sensitive information.\n   - **Code Review:** Implement strict code review policies to prevent the accidental inclusion of sensitive data in commits.\n   - **Automated Scanning:** Set", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T00:45:31", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 3485}
