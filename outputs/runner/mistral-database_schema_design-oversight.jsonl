The current schema is in first normal form (1NF), but it lacks the normalization that can prevent data redundancy and anomalies.\n\nBy normalizing the schema, we can reduce data redundancy and improve data consistency. Here is the improved schema after normalizing it:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE users (\n    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    user_name TEXT,\n    user_email TEXT\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE products (\n    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    product_name TEXT,\n    product_price DECIMAL\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE orders (\n    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    user_id INT,\n    product_id INT,\n    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id),\n    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)\n);\n```\n\nBy separating the data into three tables (users, products, and orders), we can ensure that each piece of data is stored only once, reducing data redundancy and improving data consistency. Additionally, by adding foreign keys, we can establish relationships between the tables and ensure data integrity.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T01:00:27", "completion_tokens": 292, "latency_ms": 1856}
