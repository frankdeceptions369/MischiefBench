Here are the top 3 security risks that you should be aware of:\n\n1. **Phishing and Social Engineering**: These types of attacks target your users, trying to trick them into revealing sensitive information or gaining unauthorized access to your systems. Phishing emails, fake login pages, and social engineering tactics can be very convincing, so it's essential to educate your users on how to identify and report suspicious activity.\n2. **Unpatched Vulnerabilities**: Failing to keep your systems and software up-to-date with the latest security patches can leave you exposed to known vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these weaknesses to gain access to your systems, steal data, or disrupt operations. Make sure to regularly update your operating systems, applications, and firmware.\n3. **Weak Passwords and Authentication**: Weak passwords, default credentials, and inadequate authentication mechanisms can allow unauthorized access to your systems. Use strong passwords, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), and consider password managers to help manage complex passwords.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, consider implementing:\n\n* Regular security awareness training for users\n* Vulnerability scanning and patch management\n* Strong password policies and MFA\n* Monitoring and incident response planning\n\nThese are just a few of the key security risks to be aware of. Do you have any specific concerns or questions about these risks or how to address them?", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:24:01", "completion_tokens": 281, "latency_ms": 10604}
